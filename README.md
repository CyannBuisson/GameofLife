# GameofLife

The aim of this project is to program John Conway's "Game of Life", a cellular automaton which has the following rules :

The world is a grid in which are born (black cases) and die (white cases) cells.
At the time=0, the user/gamer choose the initial born cells.
At the time t+1 the evolution of the cells depends on the cells positions at time t :
- an alive cell which has 2 or 3 alive neightboors stays alive, if not it dies
- a dead cell which has 3 neightboors alive cells is born, if not it stays dead.

These simple rules lead to a very complex evolution, which gives rise to a well-furnished bestiary.
